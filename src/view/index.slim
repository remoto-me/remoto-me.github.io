        h1 A Letter from our CEO
        p.-bold Save yourself. Save the world.
        p Life is short and the world is warming. What can you do about it? I bet you already are: <span class="-strike">Remoto</span> Remote working.
        p The nature of work has changed from a place you used to go to something you do with your mobile or laptop from anywhere. Everybody became a remote worker whether they realize it or not.  Working remotely allows us to be there for the ones we love and see the world, without ever having to commute.
        p Still, it is hard to keep everybody in sync when people don't bump into each other in the water-cooler. Guess what‚Ä¶ even for people that meet in the office, effective communication doesn't just happen. How to keep a coherent customer communication when it happens by email, phone or messaging apps, and involve several people in your organization?
        p This is a problem I had myself and so did several professionals we interviewed. Remoto's goal is to allow you to communicate better with your customers and your team, and prove that people don't need to be in the same room to be on the same page.
        p Remoto is more than work tool, it is a way of thinking about work. Think outside the cubicle, be Remoto.
        p Yours,
        p.signature Fred Guth, Founder & CEO
